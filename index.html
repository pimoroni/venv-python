            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    While having to care about Python virtual environments
                    is a bit of a bump in the road to getting started with
                    Python they're not just a nuisance foisted upon you by
                    curmudgeonly Linux distribution maintainers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A virtual environment is a useful, logical way of
                    isolating your project dependencies from each other and
                    ensuring things don't break when there are conflicts..
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>eg:</strong> What happens if you create a new 
                    project using Library v2, but you have old projects that
                    only work with Library v1? Bad things, that's what. A
                    virtual environments mean you can just spin up a clean
                    environment for your new project and never have to worry
                    about breaking or updating your old ones.
                <p>
                    They are also a great way for a user to install and use
                    your project without affecting their other Python
                    environments.

                    As of Raspberry Pi OS bookworm, you'll get a slap on the
                    wrist in the form of an error message if you attempt to
                    <code>pip install</code> any Python libraries on your
                    Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It looks something like this:
                </p>
                <code>$ pip install buildhat
<span class="err">error:</span> <strong>externally-managed-environment</strong>

<span class="err"></span>×</span> This environment is externally managed
<span class="err"></span>╰─></span> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
  install.

  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
  sure you have python3-full installed.

<span class="purp">note:</span> If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
<span class="teal">hint:</span> See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.</code>
                <p>
                    The "TLDR" (too long, don't read) of this message is that
                    installing libraries from pypi (which is what pip does)
                    into your system can cause all sorts of here-be-dragons
                    weirdness and breakage. So it's recommended against.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, you use a virtual environment which is just
                    a bunch of monkeying with paths to ensure your Python
                    project dependencies are completely self-contained, and
                    isolated from the system and each other.

                <h2>Okay, fine, how can I get started?</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Virtual environments aren't half as tricky as they sound,
                    you can set one up with a single command:
                </p>
                <code>python3 -m venv --system-site-packages --prompt myenv ~/my_virtual_env</code>
                <p><em>"Uh, you said it wasn't tricky?"</em></p>
                <p>I did... didn't I...</p>
                <p>
                    Okay, let's break this down. First we
                    have <code>python3 -m venv</code>, this bit is telling
                    Python to load and run the "venv" module. Easy, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next up we have <code>--system-site-packages</code>, this
                    is a little trickier to understand. "System" in this case
                    refers to your Linux Distro, and "Site Packages" are the
                    Python packages (usually installed by "apt") available to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By specifying this argument we're asking "venv" to let our
                    virtual environment see and use these system packages.
                    This is very useful if we've got something big, complicated
                    and scary installed by "apt" that might otherwise be tricky
                    or unwildy to install in our virtual environment. In the
                    case of a Raspberry Pi, this might be <code>gpiozero</code>
                    and <code>lgpio</code> which are the default, blessed two-hit
                    combo that make GPIO access quick and easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we have <code>--prompt myenv</code>, this bit is entirely
                    optional but is useful for giving each of your virtual
                    environments a unique, friendly name so you can tell them
                    apart. This might be your project name, or anything memorable
                    to you. It'll show up in your prompt, like so:
                </p>
                <code>(myenv) <span class="user">phil@pirate</span>:<span class="path">~/</span></code>
                <p>
                    Finally, and this is it, I swear, you have the location you
                    want to put your virtual environment. This could ve anywhere
                    but in most cases you might want it in your project directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case I've chosen <code>~/my_virtual_env</code> which
                    creates the "my_virtual_env" directory inside your home
                    directory- you can get there with <code>cd ~</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use your virtual environment you must first activate it:
                </p>
                <code>source ~/my_virtual_env/bin/activate
(myenv) <span class="user">phil@pirate</span>:<span class="path">~/</code>
                <p>
                    And now you can <code>pip install</code> to your heart's
                    content!
                </p>

                <h2>Okay, that sounds tedious. Make it easy for me!</h2>

            <article>
                <p>
                    While a per-project virtual environment is a great idea
                    in principle, we're used to thinking about our Pi as the
                    project and most of the time it'll probably be doing one
                    thing. So why bother with all this complexity?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a couple of answers to this conundrum:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Update our Python software installers to check for
                        a virtual environment and ask you if you'd like one
                        created.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide a handy, dandy script you can <code>source</code>
                    from your <code>~/.bashrc</code> to make activating a
                    virtual environment automagic!</li>
                </ol>
                <p><em>"Sauce what from my whosit!?"</em></p>
                <p>
                    Right, <code>~/.bashrc</code> is a little wall-of-script
                    that gets executed every time you open a terminal window
                    on, or an SSH session into your Pi. By adding a little bit
                    of virtual environment magic into this file we can create
                    and activate a virtual environment automatically so you
                    mostly never need to think about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That script might look a little something like this:
                </p>
                <code>PY_ENV_DIR=~/Pimoroni/venv
if [ ! -f $PY_ENV_DIR/bin/activate ]; then
    printf "Creating user Python environment in $PY_ENV_DIR, please wait...\n"
    mkdir -p $PY_ENV_DIR
    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages --prompt Pimoroni $PY_ENV_DIR
fi
printf " ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓   Hello, we've activated a Python venv for you. To exit, type \"deactivate\".\n"
source $PY_ENV_DIR/bin/activate</code>
                <p>
                    This horrifying spaghetti of arcane incantations does a
                    few simple things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check for a venv in ~/Pimoroni/venv</li>
                    <li>Create one if it doesn't exist</li>
                    <li>Output a little message so you know what's happening</li>
                    <li>Activate the venv!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The first time you run it, it'll create an activate a
                    virtual environment, taking a few seconds. Subsequent runs
                    (when you open your terminal) will instantly drop you into
                    a usable, isolated environment for all your Python tinkering!

            <article>
                <h3>Is there an easier way to manage environments?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. You can install and activate virtualenvwrapper to
                    give you some handy command shortcuts for creating and
                    activating virtual environments.
                </p>
                <code><span class="user">phil@pirate</span>: sudo apt install virtualenvwrapper python3-virtualenvwrapper</code>
                <p>
                    You can then activate the virtualenvwrapper helper with:
                </p>
                <code><span class="user">phil@pirate</span>: source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh</code>
                <p>
                    If you add this line to the bottom of your <code>~/.bashrc</code>
                    then virtualenvwrapper will be activated when you log in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once activated, you can use commands like -
                </p>
                <code><span class="user">phil@pirate</span>: mkvirtualenv virtual_environment_name
<span class="user">phil@pirate</span>: workon virtual_environment_name
                </code>
                <p>You can <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">read more about virtualenvwrapper here.</a></p>
                <h3>Running my Python code as superuser/sudo</h3>
                <p>
                    I can feel the glassy, disapproving stares on the back of
                    my head as I write this, but: sometimes it's okay to use
                    <code>sudo</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notable cases might include running Python libraries like
                    <code>rpi_ws281x</code> which control WS2812 (a.k.a NeoPixels)
                    LEDs by using low-level Linux wizardry and hardware pokery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to use <code>sudo</code> inside a virtual environment
                    will normally result in sadness and bad times, but you can
                    fix that with one weird trick:
                </p>
                <code>sudo --preserve-env=PATH python my_code.py</code>
                <p>
                    Since virtual environments monkey with <code>$PATH</code>
                    to work their magic, we want to be sure that <code>sudo</code>
                    works within the context of our monkey'd <code>$PATH</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The argument <code>--preserve-env=PATH</code> does just that!
